/**
 * \class SimObject
 * \brief This class represents a simulated object with graphics and physics.
 *
 * When a SimObject is generated its graphic actor (actor_) and physics body
 * (rigid_body_) has to be added to the renderer and physics world.
 * After which, the pose of the graphical representation will be
 * automatically updated by the physics simulation, thanks the
 * toBulletVTKMotionState member. To learn more about how to add simObjects
 * to the simulation world refer to VTKTask.h
 *
 * \arg To construct a SimObject at least 3 arguments are needed:
 *
 *      ObjectShape: Can be predefined shapes (ex: ObjectType::SPHERE) or mesh
 *      (ObjectType::MESH). In the Mesh case the address of the .obj file
 *      must be provided with the mesh_address argument.
 *
 *      dimensions: If ObjectShape is one of the predefined shapes the
 *      dimensions must be specified as an array described in ObjectShape
 *      enum definition.
 *
 *      ObjectType: Four cases
 *          1. NOPHYSICS: The physics will not be included.
 *          2. KINEMATIC: The pose of the object will be set at each
 *          iteration using the SetKinematicPose. This is useful for things
 *          like tools that their pose is read from a master device.
 *          3. DYNAMIC and density!=0.0 The pose of the object will be
 *          automatically update from the physics simulation.
 *          4. DYNAMIC and no density provided (density defults to 0.0) in
 *          this case the object will be Static, meaning its pose will be
 *          constant but dynamic objects can collide with the object
 * Other params:
 *      Density: Is needed for dynamic objects to calculate their mass.
 *      pose: The Initial pose of the dynamics objects.
 *      friction: friction!
 *      id: can be used in collision detection
 *      texture_address: For Sphere and Plane shapes you can have a texture
 *      image. PNG and JPG formats are supported.
 *
 * \attention MESH:  Meshes are decomposed into approximated compound meshes
 * using the VHACD method. Generating the approximated compound mesh can take
 * up to a few minutes. So we do this only once and save the compound mesh in
 * a separate file that has the same name of the original mesh file with an
 * added _hacd. Next time the application is executed we search for the file
 * with _hacd and if found, it is used and compound mesh generation is not
 * repeated.
 * Note: The generated compound meshes are approximate and
 * sometimes the approximation deviates considerably from the original mesh.
 * To check how the generated compound object looks like, you can either open
 * the generated <filename>_hacd.obj in blender or set the show_compound_mesh
 * boolean to true in the constructor of SimObject.
 *
 * \attention Dimension scaling: We were interested in objects with
 * dimensions in the order of a few millimiters. It turned out that the bullet
 * simulation becomes unstable for such small dimensions. To get around this,
 * the dimensions of all the bullet related things are multiplied by
 * B_DIM_SCALE.
